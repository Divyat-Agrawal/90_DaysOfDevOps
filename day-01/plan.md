# 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan

## Current Level
I am currently at a beginner level in DevOps and Cloud, with strong interest in learning how modern applications are built and managed.

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a practice that combines development and operations to deliver software faster and more reliably through automation and collaboration.  
Cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure where applications run and services are managed.

## Why I Am Starting This Journey
I want to gain practical, real-world skills that help me understand how software is deployed, automated, and maintained in production environments.

## My 3 Goals for the Next 90 Days
1. Deploy an application on a cloud platform
2. Understand and implement a basic CI/CD pipeline
3. Learn containerization and Kubernetes fundamentals

## 3 Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build
- Linux fundamentals and troubleshooting
- CI/CD automation concepts
- Containers and orchestration basics

## Weekly Time Commitment
- Weekdays: 2 hours per day
- Weekends: 4–5 hours per day

## My Consistency Strategy
- Daily learning and hands-on practice
- Daily GitHub commits to track progress
- Sharing my journey publicly to stay accountable

This plan is my commitment to building strong DevOps foundations through consistent effort over the next 90 days.
