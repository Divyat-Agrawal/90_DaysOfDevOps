# 🚀 Log Analyzer in Bash (Beginner Friendly DevOps Project)

When I started learning DevOps, I realized something very important:

> Logs are everything.

If a server crashes,  
If a database fails,  
If users can't login —

The first thing engineers check is **logs**.

So today, we are building a **Log Analyzer Script** in Bash that:

- Accepts a log file
- Counts errors
- Finds critical issues
- Shows top error messages
- Generates a report
- Archives the log

This project is designed for **absolute beginners**.
